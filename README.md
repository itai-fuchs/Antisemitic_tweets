# Tweet_investigation

In this project we will receive a csv file containing tweets on Twitter classified as anti-Semitic. 

We will convert it to a data frame (class loader)

perform analysis and tests on the tweets (data anlayaze class).

In addition, we will filter the table to relevant columns (cleaner class).

and export the results to designated files (export class)
